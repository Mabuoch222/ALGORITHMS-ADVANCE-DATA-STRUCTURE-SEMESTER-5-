# Advanced Data Structures

A comprehensive collection of implementations and explanations for advanced data structures used in computer science.

## Overview

Advanced Data Structures are complex, specialized formats for organizing and managing data efficiently. They solve specific computational problems that basic structures (like arrays or linked lists) cannot handle optimally, offering improved time and space complexity for operations like search, insertion, deletion, and querying.

## Categories & Structures

### 1. Tree-Based Structures
Structures that organize data hierarchically.

| Structure | Description | Time Complexity (Avg) | Use Cases |
|:----------|:------------|:----------------------|:----------|
| **AVL Tree** | Self-balancing BST with strict height balance | Insert/Delete/Search: O(log n) | Databases, memory-efficient maps |
| **Red-Black Tree** | Self-balancing BST with color properties | Insert/Delete/Search: O(log n) | Java TreeMap, C++ map, kernel schedulers |
| **B-Tree** | Balanced tree with multiple keys per node | All operations: O(log n) | Database indexing, file systems |
| **B+ Tree** | B-Tree variant with all data in leaves | Search: O(log n), Range queries: O(log n + k) | Database indexing (MySQL, PostgreSQL) |
| **Trie** | Prefix tree for string storage | Insert/Search: O(L) [L = string length] | Autocomplete, spell check, IP routing |

### 2. Heap-Based Structures
Structures that prioritize element access.

| Structure | Description | Time Complexity | Use Cases |
|:----------|:------------|:----------------|:----------|
| **Binary Heap** | Complete binary tree with heap property | Insert/Extract: O(log n) | Priority queues, heap sort |
| **Fibonacci Heap** | Collection of trees with lazy operations | Insert: O(1), Extract-Min: O(log n) | Dijkstra's algorithm, optimization problems |
| **Binomial Heap** | Set of binomial trees | Union: O(1), Insert: O(1) | Priority queue operations |

### 3. Spatial Structures
Structures for multi-dimensional data.

| Structure | Description | Use Cases |
|:----------|:------------|:----------|
| **Quad Tree** | Recursively divides 2D space into quadrants | Image processing, collision detection |
| **k-d Tree** | Space partitioning for k-dimensional points | Nearest neighbor search, range queries |
| **R-Tree** | Tree structure for spatial access methods | Geographic information systems (GIS) |

### 4. Probabilistic Structures
Memory-efficient structures for approximate results.

| Structure | Description | Use Cases |
|:----------|:------------|:----------|
| **Bloom Filter** | Probabilistic membership test | Web cache sharing, spam filtering |
| **Count-Min Sketch** | Frequency estimation in data streams | Network traffic monitoring, trend detection |
| **HyperLogLog** | Cardinality estimation | Unique visitor counting, distinct elements |

### 5. Specialized Structures
Structures for specific algorithmic problems.

| Structure | Description | Time Complexity | Use Cases |
|:----------|:------------|:----------------|:----------|
| **Segment Tree** | Allows range queries and updates | Query/Update: O(log n) | Range queries, interval problems |
| **Fenwick Tree (BIT)** | Efficient prefix sum calculations | Query/Update: O(log n) | Prefix sums, frequency counting |
| **Disjoint-Set (Union-Find)** | Manages partitions of sets | Near constant time with path compression | Connected components, graph algorithms |
